# SkillLink üåê

SkillLink is a mobile-first skill-exchange platform that empowers users to showcase their talents, find collaborators, and connect with others for mutual learning or service exchange. Built with **React Native (frontend)** and **Spring Boot with AWS (backend)**, the app supports real-time messaging, secure authentication, and customizable skill listings.

Why this app? What are the features that make it different from other apps that do the same job of linking two people to learn from each other?
Not everyone can afford paid classes ‚Äî and that‚Äôs okay. That‚Äôs exactly why my app exists. It gives people the chance to exchange skills instead. You teach something you know, and in return, you get to learn something new. But let‚Äôs be real ‚Äî things aren‚Äôt always that simple. What if I want to learn piano, and the only person teaching piano wants to learn Spanish‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt know Spanish? That‚Äôs where my app offers flexibility. If I can‚Äôt offer the skill they‚Äôre looking for, I can offer money instead. And if that‚Äôs still not the right fit, I can share a list of other skills I‚Äôm good at and willing to teach. This gives the other person more options ‚Äî and maybe they‚Äôll even discover something they didn‚Äôt know they wanted to learn. In the end, it‚Äôs all about making learning more accessible, flexible, and personal ‚Äî whether through skill swaps, payments, or unexpected new interests.
